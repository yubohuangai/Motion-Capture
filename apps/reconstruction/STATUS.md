# Reconstruction Project — Live Status

> **Purpose**: single source of truth for "where are we *right now*". Updated
> after every completed unit of work and committed to git. If a Claude session
> dies (bus error etc.), the next session reads this file and continues
> without losing context.
>
> **Architectural decisions, pipeline overview, design rationale** → `PROJECT.md`.
> **Live progress, last completed step, next command** → this file.

## Current stage

**Stage 1 → Stage 2 handoff.** Stage 1 (per-frame COLMAP MVS) is complete on
the 60-frame `cow_1/9148_10581` sweep. Stage 2 (LocalDyGS) is fully set up:
env built, both upstream patches landed, prep script written. The remaining
hop is **executing `prepare_localdygs_data.py` on real Stage 1 outputs for
the first time**, then a smoke-test LocalDyGS training run.

## Last completed

**Stage 1 → Stage 2 prep succeeded** (job `59959992`, 17 s wall, cleanply venv):
`/scratch/yubo/cow_1/9148_10581_output/stage_b/localdygs_scene/` has 60 frame
dirs × 11 image symlinks, 11 cameras renumbered 0..10 PINHOLE 3840×2160 (4K
preserved), init pcd `pcds/downsample_0_60.ply` 73,784 pts (3.8 MB) — voxel
size 0.035 hit the ≤90K target on the 8.6 M-point combined input.

## Next concrete step

**In flight: smoke-test training job 59960152** (commit `51b985b` —
`scripts/slurm/run_localdygs_smoke.sh` + `apps/.../configs/cow_smoke.py`).
500 iterations on a single A100, ~5–10 min wall, output to
`/scratch/yubo/cow_1/9148_10581_output/stage_b/smoke_<timestamp>/`.
Watcher running; will dump logs on completion.

After smoke succeeds: run full-iteration training (30000 iters with
upstream basketball.py config) — same scene, separate output dir.
