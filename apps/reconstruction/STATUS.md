# Reconstruction Project — Live Status

> **Purpose**: single source of truth for "where are we *right now*". Updated
> after every completed unit of work and committed to git. If a Claude session
> dies (bus error etc.), the next session reads this file and continues
> without losing context.
>
> **Architectural decisions, pipeline overview, design rationale** → `PROJECT.md`.
> **Live progress, last completed step, next command** → this file.

## Current stage

**Stage 1 → Stage 2 handoff.** Stage 1 (per-frame COLMAP MVS) is complete on
the 60-frame `cow_1/9148_10581` sweep. Stage 2 (LocalDyGS) is fully set up:
env built, both upstream patches landed, prep script written. The remaining
hop is **executing `prepare_localdygs_data.py` on real Stage 1 outputs for
the first time**, then a smoke-test LocalDyGS training run.

## Last completed

**LPIPS/VGG16 weights pre-cached on login node + fail-fast guard added**
(commit `b1304d4`). VGG16 backbone (528 MB) at
`~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/vgg16-397923af.pth`. LPIPS bundled
weights (vgg/alex/squeeze, ~25 KB total) at
`~/envs/localdygs/lib/python3.11/site-packages/lpips/weights/v0.1/`
(fetched from upstream GitHub; wheelhouse lpips ships without them).
Smoke sbatch now fails in 1 s if either is missing.

Prior: prep job `59959992` succeeded (60 frames, 73,784-pt init pcd).
Smoke job `59960152` failed at 9 min on `URLError [Errno 101] Network
is unreachable` — train.py downloads VGG16 at import; compute nodes
have no internet.

## Next concrete step

**In flight: smoke job 59960468** (resubmission with weights cached).
Same config (500 iters, single A100, cow_smoke.py).
Watcher running.

After smoke succeeds: full 30000-iter training run with upstream
basketball.py config.
